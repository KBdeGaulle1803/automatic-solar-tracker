# automatic-solar-tracker
Design Lab Project during the sixth semester at IIT Guwahati under Prof. Shaik Rafi Ahamed.
This system has an important utility in these days where we are aiming to decrease our dependance on non-renewable fuels as it increases the power generation of a solar panel by ensuring that it always faces the sun, hence getting maximum irradiance.
In this project, we built a system using 4 LDRs to aid in comparison of solar intensity in each direction and help in deciding the direction of rotation. The rotation is along two axes, one servo motor for 60 degrees vertical range and two servo motors for 240 degree horizontal range.
